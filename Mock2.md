Key Technical Concepts Discussed



| Topic                   | Explanation / Candidate’s Response                                                                                      |

|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Python Platform          | Python is platform-independent.                                                                                         |

| Interpreted Language     | Python executes code line-by-line, unlike compiled languages that compile the entire code before running.                |

| PIP                     | Python package installer used to install external libraries like Django, MySQL client, Flask, and others from the web.   |

| Collections             | Python collections include list, tuple, set, dictionary. Tuple is immutable and preferred when memory efficiency is needed.|

| Pandas                  | Candidate is aware of pandas for data cleaning and statistics but has not practiced it.                                  |

| API Development         | APIs enable communication between front-end and back-end; candidate uses Django REST framework for API creation.         |

| Serialization \& Privacy | REST APIs use serialization to transfer data securely and maintain data privacy between systems.                         |

| JSON                    | JSON is a key-value pair data format similar to Python dictionaries.                                                     |

| Dictionary Operations   | Keys are unique; values can be duplicated. Iteration via `.keys()`, `.values()`, `.items()` methods.                      |

| SQL Role in Python      | SQL is used to interact with databases; candidate writes APIs that interact with MySQL databases using ORM (Object Relational Mapping). |

| Django Architecture     | Works on MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture; model defines database structure, views handle business logic, templates handle HTML. |

| Django Commands         | `py manage.py inspectdb` generates Django models from existing databases.                                               |

| REST API Protocols      | Primarily uses REST APIs; unaware of alternatives.                                                                       |

| HTTP Methods            | POST is used to add data to the database; PUT/PATCH for updating; GET for fetching data.                                  |

| Django Static Folder    | Stores CSS, JavaScript, images; naming and path conventions are mandatory.                                               |

| Django Migrations       | Migrations folder contains table schema layouts generated from models.py via `makemigrations` command.                   |

| Decorators in Python    | Used to add functionality to existing functions without modifying them directly; candidate uses decorators in API development. |

Important Clarifications and Concepts



| Concept                   | Clarification                                                                                                                            |

|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Tuple vs List             | Tuples are immutable and faster due to better memory management; lists are mutable but consume more memory.                               |

| Joining Dictionaries      | Uncertain if dictionaries can be concatenated using `+` operator; invite viewers to comment on this.                                       |

| HTTP Method Usage         | POST inserts data; PUT/PATCH updates; GET only retrieves data and cannot be used for inserting or updating.                               |

| Django Template (Jinja)  | Enables embedding Python-like logic (conditions, loops) in HTML; pure HTML does not support logic.                                        |

| Static Folder Path       | Must be named `static` and path cannot be changed; Django requires this convention.                                                       |

| Migrations Folder        | Contains schema and metadata of database tables created from Django models.                                                               |

| Decorators               | Allow enhancing or modifying behavior of functions without changing their core code; useful for adding features to built-in or third-party functions. |
